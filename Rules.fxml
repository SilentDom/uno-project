      <TextArea editable="false" layoutX="14.0" layoutY="14.0" prefHeight="575.0" prefWidth="775.0" text="Uno is a highly popular card game played by millions around the globe. This game is played by matching and then discarding the cards in one’s hand until none are left. Since its inception, there are now many versions of Uno that one can play. Here are the rules of the original or classic Uno that is replicated in this program.&#10;&#10;Setup: &#10;The game is setup for up to 4 players, ages 7 and over. Every player starts with seven cards, and they are dealt face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. Next to the pile is a space designated for the Discard Pile. The top card is placed in the Discard Pile, and the game begins!&#10;&#10;Game Play: &#10;The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer and gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction. Every player views their cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.&#10;&#10;You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. For instance, if the Discard Pile has a green card that is an 3 you have to place either a green card or a card with an 3 on it. You can also play a Wild card (which can change the current color in play).&#10;&#10;If the player has no matches, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card, and continue drawing until you get a card that can be played. You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn. Take note that you can only put down one card at a time.&#10;&#10;The game continues until a player has one card left. The moment a player has just one card they must press the “Call Uno” button. If they do not press this button before ending their turn, that player must draw a card as a penalty. Assuming that the player is unable to play/discard their last card and needs to draw, but after drawing, is then able to play/discard that penultimate card, the player has to repeat the action of pressing the “Call Uno” button. &#10;&#10;Once a player has no cards remaining, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Action Cards: Besides the number cards, there are several other cards that help mix up the game. These are called Action or Symbol cards.&#10;&#10;Reverse – &#10;If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Reverse card.&#10;    &#10;Skip – &#10;When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Skip card.&#10;    &#10;Draw Two – &#10;When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Draw Two.&#10;    &#10;Wild – &#10;This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to choose which color it will represent for the next player. It can be played regardless of whether another card is available. &#10;    &#10;Wild Draw Four – &#10;This acts just like the wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards as well.&#10;" wrapText="true">
