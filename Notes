Document changes from initial design to final

Progress of implementations
 
Talk about major challenges and how we overcame them

Necessities:
- Wild card functionality - Matthew (have to get a color assigned to the wild card)
- Implement gimmick actions for cards (special actions for 0 and 7 cards) - Caleb
- Implement up to 4 player functionality - Caleb (currently have 2 players 2 computer players, hardcoded)

Bugs/Issues:
1. Computer plays a random card regardless of the color chosen after a Wild card is played.

2. Merge wild card logic in to the cardAction() method then call it from the playCard() method if the card is an action card.
