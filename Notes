Document changes from initial design to final

Progress of implementations
 
Talk about major challenges and how we overcame them

Necessities:
- Wild card functionality - Matthew
- Make the discard pile the new deck if the deck is empty - Matthew
- Implement gimmick actions for cards (special actions for 0 and 7 cards) - Caleb
- Implement up to 4 player functionality - Caleb

Luxuries:
- Give a time limit for playing cards/time limit to press the call UNO button (having them draw a card if they do not press the button before their turn ends - Dom

Bugs/Issues:
1. Computer plays a random card regardless of the color chosen after a Wild card is played.

2. Method nextPlayer() potentially unneeded, already have a global variable for tracking the players' turns.

3. Merge wild card logic in to the cardAction() method then call it from the playCard() method if the card is an action card.
